Developing an environment in which you and your team are consistently sharing and learning new things is crucial to surviving in the fast-paced world we find ourselves in. According to HackerRank’s 2019 Developer Skills Report professional growth matters most to developers when looking for a new job.

“The most important factors for developers, across all job levels and functions, was the opportunity for professional growth and work-life balance.”

The word “culture” can easily be substituted with “mindset” in this article, as it’s just as applicable to one man bands. So, whether you’re a company or an individual, here are 6 effective ways in which to cultivate a continuous learning environment.

## 1. Read widely, make it a habit

## 2. Keep smart company

Surround yourself with people who are smarter or think differently than you whenever you can. Hire curious people.

## 3. Share what you know

It’s really, quite simple: [See one, do one, teach one](https://pjrvs.com/doone/)

If you require further incentive, [learning by teaching has proven to be extremely effective.](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/)

## 4. [Keep a list of things you want to learn](https://github.com/tinavanschelt/lifelong-learning/)

## 5. Start your own (side) project

Internal or side projects are a great opportunity to experiment with new tools and frameworks.

## 6. Prioritise learning
