It was just a regular Saturday. My husband went to Builder‚Äôs Warehouse, a pretty standard outing for young home owners. When he came home, he asked me if it was okay if we spent a little extra money that month and subsequently presented me with a big blue dog collar and leash. There may have been tears.

That afternoon we went to a dog shelter in the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town, Bella‚Äôs Guardian Angles, were me met a little guy now known as Wilco (and now not so little!). Two years later and I‚Äôm still waiting for my heart to stop expanding.

The date was 5 August 2017. Little did we know that two months later, my husband would be interviewing for a position within his consulting firm at their office in Limerick, Ireland and 6 months later I would be boarding a plane, watching as they load our BFG into said plane. Getting Wilco to Ireland was definitely one of the most costly and stressful aspects of our move and I regularly get questions about the process, so I‚Äôve decided to document it here.

Our two year contract is coming to an end soon and since my husband has Dutch citizenship and I work remotely, we‚Äôll be moving to Amsterdam for another two year assignment before, most likely, heading home üáøüá¶

Before I jump, it's probably good to state that we flew from Cape Town to Dublin and our dog was about 22kg at the time. Your route and the size of your dog will affect the cost of travel.

## First things first: visit your veterinarian

Regardless of the destination or method of travel, your local veterinarian will always be your first stop. If your dog is coming from a high-risk rabies country, like South Africa, the waiting period after your first veterinarian visit is a minimum of three to four months if you want to avoid quarantine.

    <b>Microchip</b> 
    Nowadays many countries, Ireland included, have made it a legal requirement to microchip pet. As responsible dog owners, our dog was already chipped as a puppy, but it‚Äôs important to scan the microchip when you intend to travel (and on your yearly vet visit) for a number of reasons:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Microchips can move (especially if it was inserted at a young age)</li>
    <li>The Microchip has to be compatible with ISO standard 11785*</li>
    <li>The Microchip has to be scanned and confirmed before vaccinating and drawing blood</li>
  </ul>

It‚Äôs important the information on your Microchip form is correct and that the dog description is both specific and accurate

\*Our dog had an Identipet chip. Regardless of the make of the chip, I would verify it‚Äôs compatibility with both your veterinarian and the manufacturer

  </li>

    <b>Rabies Vaccination</b>
    If your dog is travelling from a high-risk rabies country you have to vaccinate (or boost) for rabies. The rabies vaccination should have a 3-year validity period. This is a good time to double check that your dogs regular vaccinations and boosters are up to date too.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Blood Tests for Rabies Certificate</b>
    There is a thirty day waiting period between the vaccination and the blood tests. Once the required thirty days has passed your dog‚Äôs blood can be drawn for the titre test, AKA the RNATT (Rabies Neutralising Antibody Titre Test Declaration). This is where the waiting game begins. From the day the blood was drawn, your dog needs to wait three months* before they can travel.

In South Africa, your vet will send the blood sample to Onderstepoort, where they will test the sample to determine if your dog has enough antibodies. It‚Äôs a fairly standard procedure. After about two weeks you will be able to collect the certificate from your veterinarian.

I can‚Äôt remember the exact cost of the RNATT exercise, but I would budget ~‚Ç¨300 for all pre-flight vet fees.

\*If your pet cannot wait three months locally, they will have to spend the remainder of the time in quarantine at your destination. A better option would be to have the pet stay with friends or relatives and have them join you at a later date.

## Organising your dogs flight

Though you may now find yourself in somewhat of a waiting game, there‚Äôs no rest for the wicked!‚Ä®‚Ä®Due to the Common Travel Area agreement of 1923 Ireland and the UK share the same import requirements when it comes to pets. This is where the bad news comes in. If you travel to most European countries, you can travel with your pet as ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù luggage, if you‚Äôre flying to Ireland or the UK, your pet _has_ to come as cargo and the only way to get your dog into cargo is by working with an agency and agencies are expensive. We used Animal Travel Services and could not recommend them more highly. They also happened to be, by quite some margin, the most affordable quote we received.

Brexit might affect the above and regulations change regularly. Again, I would recommend that you contact pet friendly airlines such as KLM, Lufthansa and Swiss Air to query the route. Approved airlines depend on your destination. The airline will be able to confirm whether or not your dog is allowed to enter the country as check-in luggage. To give you an indication of check-in vs cargo costs, last time I check, KLM has a flat international rate of ‚Ç¨200 (+‚Ç¨150 if your layover is more than 2 hours) when your dog travels in the hold. If your pet is flying cargo, you‚Äôre probably looking at ‚Ç¨1500, but that figure is size dependent.

Working with an agency was costly, but with the benefit of hindsight, I‚Äôm very glad we didn‚Äôt have another option and that we had assistance during the process. In addition to being less stressful, there are a number of benefits that come with working through an agency, keep reading.

## Getting the right crate for you dog

If your dog is travelling cargo, it _has_ to travel in a big wooden crate. If your dog is travelling in the hold it has to be in a IATA approved plastic crate. If, like us, you switch things up every couple of years, this is a little frustrating as our dog now has two impossibly large crates. One plastic and one wooden. The wooden crate will be provided through your travel agency - I would recommend sticking with their standard crate. The requirements for the plastic crate differs depending on the airline, but they‚Äôll most likely have a detailed spec of their website.‚Ä®‚Ä®Both our crates cost ~‚Ç¨200 each, but the crate cost is size dependent.

## The week before take-off

Paperwork! An EU health certificate must be completed by your veterinary practitioner, between 5 and 1 days before travelling. In other words, at least 24 hours before travelling, but not longer than 120 hours. The certificate then needs to be signed by an Official State Veterinarian. In Cape Town the state veterinarian is located in Milnerton and only open between 9am and 12pm on weekdays. This is were an agency is very helpful. You will have a lot of things on your plate that last week before lift-off, the agency will collect the certificate from you and get it to the state vet in time

## The day of take-off

The agency will collect your dog early. In our case my flight was late afternoon and Animal Travel Services collected Wilco at about 9:30 in the morning. The driver was animal whisperer and just reassuring all round. The agency will get your dog and his crate flight-ready and truthfully, I needed that last day to get my own admin in order. There are so many moving parts and little tasks, like phoning the bank.

## The flight

Regardless of whether your dog travels check-in or cargo, in reality all animals travel in the hold. I‚Äôve been told that they have the best seat in the house as the hold is one of the quietest parts of the plane and, for what it‚Äôs worth, the crew has access to the hold during flight. Wilco and I travelled on the same Swiss Air flight and I can highly recommend this. When I saw him disembarking at Zurich Airport, ears flapping, I knew we were going to be just fine.

If you have a layover in Europe, your pet is cleared at their first entry point. In our case, Wilco was cleared by the veterinarian at Zurich Airport. If you have a direct flight to Dublin, your dog will be cleared at Dublin Airport. In the event of a layover they will let your dog out and if any of his belongings (like a blanket) are dirty, they will tape it to the outside of his crate.

## Reunited at last

If you‚Äôre travelling to Ireland, there‚Äôs only one point of entry for pets arriving by plane: Dublin Airport. You‚Äôll collect your dog from World Freight Services next to the airport. There is a small import / handling fee of about ~‚Ç¨40.

The entire endeavour cost us just over ‚Ç¨2000 (30 000 ZAR). At the time it was a bitter pill to swallow, but having gone through it, I can now truthfully say that I would pay double tomorrow.
