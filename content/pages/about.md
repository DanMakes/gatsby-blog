### Intro

Growing up, I loved art and I loved computers.

I excelled at anything that allowed me to create or build something. I decided to study Design and Art Direction at The Red & Yellow Creative School of Business, but simply could not shake the coding hobby and freelanced as a web developer throughout my studies and early career. Consequently, my skills have been built up through relentless self-study, loads of curiosity and an above average amount of grit.

I have a keen interest in human behaviour and always strive to surround myself with people who are smarter than me.
