My [personal website](https://tinavanschelt.com). Intended for stashing and sharing what I learn, exercise my writing muscle and keep track of my personal and professional growth.

The site is built with [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), using the [typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) Lincoln theme (with some minor modifications).

Kudos goes to [@kylemathews](https://twitter.com/kylemathews) and the Gatsby team for building an awesome product.
